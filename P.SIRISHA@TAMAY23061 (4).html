    <p><strong>Project Title:</strong>Five-Level Inverter for Renewable Power Generation System</p>
    <p><strong><b>Discription:</b></strong>A five-level inverter is developed and applied for injecting the real power of the renewable power into the grid to reduce the switching power loss,<br>harmonic distortion, and electromagnetic interference caused by the switching operation of power electronic devices. Two dc capacitors, a dual-buck converter, <br>a full-bridge inverter, and a filter configure the five-level inverter. The input of the dual-buck converter is two dc capacitor voltage sources.The dual-buck converter<br> converts two dc capacitor voltage sources to a dc output voltage with three levels and balances these two dc capacitor voltages. The output current of the five-level <br>inverter is controlled to generate a sinusoidal current in phase with the utility voltage to inject into The experimental studies show that developed photovoltaic power<br> generation system is better than the conventional system</p>
